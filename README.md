# Alternative to UseCases

Yes, alternatives to using **Use Cases** in your architecture exist and depend on your design goals,
project size, and preference for simplicity or abstraction. While **Use Cases** provide a clear
separation of business logic and promote single responsibility, some scenarios might not require
their explicit use. Here are some alternatives:

---

### **1. Directly Using Repositories**

Instead of defining `Use Cases`, the `ViewModel` can interact directly with the repository. This
approach simplifies the architecture by removing an intermediate layer.

#### Example: ViewModel with Repository

```kotlin
class HomeViewModel(
    private val postRepository: PostRepository
) : ViewModel() {
    private val _state = MutableStateFlow(HomeState())
    val state: StateFlow<HomeState> = _state

    fun loadPosts() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            _state.value = _state.value.copy(isLoading = true)
            try {
                val posts = postRepository.getPosts()
                _state.value = _state.value.copy(posts = posts, isLoading = false)
            } catch (e: Exception) {
                _state.value = _state.value.copy(
                    isLoading = false,
                    errorMessage = e.message
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**When to Use:**

- For smaller projects where an extra abstraction layer (use cases) adds unnecessary complexity.
- When the repository logic is simple and maps directly to the ViewModel's needs.

---

### **2. Using Interactors (Similar to Use Cases but with Combined Logic)**

Instead of one use case per operation, you group related business logic into **Interactors**. Each
interactor encapsulates multiple related operations, reducing the number of classes.

#### Example: PostInteractor

```kotlin
class PostInteractor(private val postRepository: PostRepository) {
    suspend fun fetchPosts(): List<Post> {
        return postRepository.getPosts()
    }

    suspend fun getPostById(id: Int): Post {
        return postRepository.getPostById(id)
    }
}
```

#### Usage in ViewModel:

```kotlin
class HomeViewModel(
    private val postInteractor: PostInteractor
) : ViewModel() {
    fun loadPosts() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            val posts = postInteractor.fetchPosts()
            // Update state with posts
        }
    }
}
```

**When to Use:**

- Medium-sized projects where related operations can be grouped logically.
- When you still want some separation of concerns without one-use-case-per-action overhead.

---

### **3. Direct Logic in ViewModel**

If your business logic is minimal, you can place it directly in the ViewModel. This reduces layers
but sacrifices separation of concerns and testability.

#### Example:

```kotlin
class HomeViewModel(
    private val postRepository: PostRepository
) : ViewModel() {
    private val _state = MutableStateFlow(HomeState())
    val state: StateFlow<HomeState> = _state

    fun loadPosts() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            _state.value = _state.value.copy(isLoading = true)
            try {
                val posts = postRepository.getPosts()
                val filteredPosts = posts.filter { it.isPublished } // Business logic directly here
                _state.value = HomeState(posts = filteredPosts, isLoading = false)
            } catch (e: Exception) {
                _state.value = _state.value.copy(
                    isLoading = false,
                    errorMessage = e.message
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**When to Use:**

- For very small projects or proof-of-concepts.
- When business logic is simple and unlikely to grow.

---

### **4. Middleware Layer (Action Handlers)**

Instead of use cases, you can handle logic in a middleware layer that processes actions (intents)
and returns results. This fits well with MVI.

#### Example:

Middleware that processes actions and invokes repositories:

```kotlin
class ActionHandler(private val postRepository: PostRepository) {
    suspend fun handle(action: HomeIntent): HomeState {
        return when (action) {
            is HomeIntent.LoadPosts -> {
                val posts = postRepository.getPosts()
                HomeState(posts = posts)
            }
            is HomeIntent.RefreshPosts -> {
                val posts = postRepository.getFilteredPosts(action.filter)
                HomeState(posts = posts)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Usage in ViewModel:

```kotlin
class HomeViewModel(private val actionHandler: ActionHandler) : ViewModel() {
    fun dispatch(action: HomeIntent) {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            val newState = actionHandler.handle(action)
            _state.value = newState
        }
    }
}
```

**When to Use:**

- When you want to centralize logic processing outside of the ViewModel.
- Fits well with reactive patterns like MVI or Redux.

---

### **5. Service Layer**

Introduce a **Service Layer** that handles business logic and coordinates between multiple
repositories or APIs. This is more common in larger enterprise-level projects.

#### Example: PostService

```kotlin
class PostService(
    private val postRepository: PostRepository,
    private val userRepository: UserRepository
) {
    suspend fun getUserPosts(userId: Int): List<Post> {
        val user = userRepository.getUserById(userId)
        return postRepository.getPosts().filter { it.authorId == user.id }
    }
}
```

#### Usage:

The ViewModel interacts with the service layer instead of individual repositories or use cases.

**When to Use:**

- Large projects with complex domain logic requiring coordination between multiple sources.
- Projects with a service-oriented design.

### **Comparison of Alternatives**

| **Approach**             | **Pros**                                            | **Cons**                                              |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Direct Repositories**  | Simple and minimal overhead.                        | Tightly couples ViewModel to data layer.              |
| **Interactors**          | Groups related operations, reduces class count.     | Less modular than one-use-case-per-action.            |
| **Direct Logic in VM**   | Simplifies small projects.                          | Violates separation of concerns, harder to test.      |
| **Middleware (Actions)** | Centralized logic handling, works well with MVI.    | Adds an additional abstraction layer.                 |
| **Service Layer**        | Encapsulates complex logic across multiple sources. | Increased complexity, not ideal for smaller projects. |

---

### **When to Choose an Alternative**

1. **Small Projects**: Use direct repositories or logic in ViewModel to keep things simple.
2. **Medium Projects**: Use interactors or middleware for better organization without
   over-complication.
3. **Large Projects**: Stick to Use Cases or adopt a service layer for clean separation of concerns
   and scalability.
